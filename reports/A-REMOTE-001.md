# A-REMOTE-001 ? live baseline and CCM/Native reconciliation

2026-10-08. REMOTE inspection/documentation outcome: **READY FOR REVIEW**.
Coordination execution input: `769c4dc1f50acebbf855b06d4bcf9cfc5eba7e16`.
PM planning input `dd63c07` is not the execution revision. Assignment and publication dependency were verified at the execution revision. Owner explicitly invoked this Codex session to execute and publish, not prepare another prompt.

[Exact evidence index](../references/device_evidence/remote/A-REMOTE-001/INDEX.md) contains immutable entry snapshots, hashes, original approval excerpt, comparison and verification records. Relative source paths below refer to that snapshot's `snapshot/` tree. No firmware, test, configuration, library or artifact edits; no test run/build/upload/hardware activity; no contract approval or common-gate closure.

## 1. Recovered baseline and provenance

| Item | Current inspected fact / limit |
| --- | --- |
| Workspace | `C:/Users/RYZEN/Documents/REMOTE01/Code`, inspected 2026-10-08. No `.git` or inherited repository identity; branch/HEAD and dirty-against-commit unavailable. No Git initialization. Entry SHA inventory replaces a fabricated commit. |
| Inventory | 4038 files hashed at entry; 1704 outside `.pio/` published as path/hash inventory. Generated test products may be among them; no claim they are all source. |
| Target | `platformio.ini`: remote01 / espressif32@6.13.0 / ESP-IDF package3.50503.0 / Xtensa14.2.0+20251107 / esp32-s3-devkitc-1 target / custom16MiB partitions. Device board is documented Waveshare3.49B V2 Rev1.1; no new physical inspection. |
| Version | Existing app descriptor: project `12_LVGL_Test`, project version `1`, IDF5.5.3, build text `Oct 6 2026 23:57:20` (timezone unspecified). Not a product release identifier. sdkconfig.defaults' old5.3.2 header is not the resolved SDK. |
| Existing BIN | 2,485,824 bytes; SHA `7e8d77c21898014fbd7ea625cf2d25aa7f77941d5ba1d24484090f7361279afb`. |
| Existing ELF | 17,777,512 bytes; SHA `61d077235a971919807bcff38aede169554f60de1ea7152625e5aa5b0b730525`. BIN's embedded ELF SHA matches this complete ELF hash. This proves artifact pairing, not build success/current-source correspondence. |
| Partition BIN | 3072 bytes; SHA `d7ffd497cfcd33e697304b3cf8112e7a1f1cb0619639fe9879ed431cbbdc8835`, matches recorded rollback partition hash. |
| Artifact provenance | Current BIN/ELF differ from recorded rollback BIN `d2938335?` / ELF `7fece2e8?`; BIN is64 bytes smaller. Cause UNKNOWN. No current reproducible build/linked-flash/static-RAM measurement or flashed-image identity is inferred. Existing BIN arithmetic leaves659904 bytes in a3145728-byte OTA slot; not an OTA writer acceptance or fresh linker margin. |
| Prior analysis | October7 requirements handoff already exists and matches imported canonical handoff exactly, SHA `fc6303f73c231e3abad91171ce0ea29ad05afe2b4c27833c5bd8743f79246c12`. Reused as requirements, not a completed live-source mapping. Prior prompt branch only published an instruction; it supplied no executed report/handoff. |

### Frozen CCM recovered, not newly approved

Actual `docs/COMMON_CONTROL_MODEL_V1.md`,113347 bytes, SHA `7a46f9fffe706476de458aac078d0af1c94844df339248d3f9f4b5cf033011d7`, identifies OWNER APPROVED / FROZEN1.0.0 dated2026-10-03. Section21 and CHANGELOG's October3 owner-freeze entry corroborate the status.

Original owner instruction is recovered from this session's attachment `73e8283c-9f10-4dec-aa3f-7db8d6a9e94a/Pasted text.txt`: line24 explicitly approves the freeze; lines54?69 prescribe candidate.4 ->1.0.0/status-only transition. Full attachment SHA `80d72f646b4cddcecda97a333859a9907a1cf944fc6f5ccdba13b291c07ff897`. Published lines1?135 are a byte-preserved excerpt; full source path/hash/size are recorded. The attachment itself has no independent UTC approval timestamp or signature;2026-10-03 is the durable document-record date, not an invented timestamp.

Byte comparison of sections1?20 against the imported historical candidate.4 PASS with exactly: current tuple `{1,0,0,4}` -> `{1,0,0}`, and exact version check `candidate.4` -> `1.0.0`. Every other byte in those sections matches. Header and section21 differ as recorded status/provenance. Do not rename/promote the imported candidate or edit frozen semantics. The artifact/provenance availability gap is now addressed for PM review; PM decides its shared reference acceptance, not this device report.

Native candidate live SHA `0405e1844d194406f7a150568835e3bf1fda73ddb5ef18d434870f4458c0bb08`: candidate.1 UNAPPROVED/UNFROZEN, with October7 audit evidence overlay. Imported pre-audit candidate is historical. JSON/WSS/HTTPS/assets, endpoints and SDK feasibility text are not approved choices; TUNER audited SDK4.4.7 differs from REMOTE5.5.3. O01?O17 remain OPEN.

## 2. Actual control/runtime inventory

| Path / functions | Inspected implementation | Boundary / missing production evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `main/main.cpp::app_main`, `components/control_home/runtime.cpp::task/start` | Starts profile0 HOME runtime, POWER and NETWORK. UC_owner core1/priority2/24576-byte stack; waits5s then allocates development Session in PSRAM. Core writes/acquisition/one inbox event per turn stay on this owner; at most8 serial bytes and one HOME intent per turn,50ms yield. | Session is synthetic, not Native. Random `home.synthetic.boot:` epoch is not persistent non-reuse proof. |
| `control_home/include/control_home/development.hpp::Session`; `development.cpp::Device` | Fresh Store + MockJournal + MockAdapter, synthetic device/target/binding;4 operations(play/ pause/next/previous) and4 fields(playback/volume/title/subtitle). Owner-side synthetic acquisition and delayed-result hooks. | No real TUNER registration/authorization/discovery/server/client. Next/previous simulate3 tracks, not target semantics. |
| `control_home/facade.cpp::handle/snapshot`; `user_app/user_app.cpp::home_click/home_refresh` | UI sends bounded intents, owner derives explicit play/pause from selected non-conflicted state plus precondition. Session/capability capture, duplicate-token handling, disabled actions and copied presentation. Battery/IP/icon read separate owner views. | Local toggle UX does not authorize a Native toggle. HOME CONNECTED describes synthetic control binding, not associated TUNER availability. Volume presentation rounding is not command quantization. |
| `control/core.cpp::capture/validate/schedule/persist/evidence` | Scoped captures, admission/dispatch validation, deadlines, bounded results/effects, commit-before-handover hooks, historical result folds and per-key proof/barrier machinery. | Foundation slice only; physical persistence and target guarantees missing. No full CCM certification. |
| `control/ingress.cpp::Boundary::attach/apply/process_one` and header | Fixed8 copied value events, owner-only normalization, epoch/incarnation/session/mapping/device/target association checks; sample revision/media checks. Adds queue delay to verified age; rejects future/overflow samples. | Generic ingress is scalar-only (four provenance hops,4096-byte text); references/assets/catalog events not represented. Verified-sequence acquisition only; request nonce alone is not freshness proof. |
| `control/core.cpp::capability/foundation_operation/synthetic_numeric_profile` | Executable foundation allows power, volume, play/pause/stop/next/previous/source.select; rejects other SUPPORTED operation descriptors as OPERATION_SLICE_NOT_IMPLEMENTED. Single route/attempt; no automatic retry/fallback. | favorites.activate/content.launch/enumeration schemas/types existing does not make execution implemented. General numeric mapping unsupported. |
| `control/core.cpp::catalog/fresh/reconnect` | Core-owned catalog merging/generations and scope/session validation; current reference freshness; reconnect invalidates observations and changes session/capability availability. | No production stable-token rebind/explicit deletion extension or target guard proof; no asynchronous Native catalog ingress. Native revision cannot be assigned directly to common generation. |

`model.hpp::Limits`:4 devices,8 targets,16 bindings,32 capabilities,16 fields/resources,1024 records,64 queue/events,1152 barriers; Memory budget4MiB is a local foundation budget, not a Native/TUNER capacity recommendation. Limits and allocation strategies do not replace TUNER measurements.

## 3. Outgoing mapping ? common intent to Native requirement

All rows are proposals/requirements, not installed adapters or endpoints. CCM sections6/10?17 remain authoritative. Lack of a proved mapping is UNKNOWN/unavailable; explicit verified absence is UNSUPPORTED. Never invent support to fill UI rows.

| Common intent / control need | Required Native behavior and proof | Current gap / handling / owner |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Identity/compatibility/discovery/association prerequisite | Stable verified TUNER identity independent of IP/name; compatible API negotiation, deliberately persisted association plus separate authorization; mDNS/manual locator produces candidates only. | Outside common playback operations; REMOTE client/registry/UI absent, TUNER identity/association absent. Block affected binding readiness. Both; O03?O06/O16/O17. |
| `playback.play {}`; resume when paused | Explicit desired operation tied to captured media/session, truthful transition/result, target-side context guarantee; resume variant reviewed without adding a CCM operation. | Core supports foundation operation, HOME Mock play only. TUNER internal play(url,codec)/resume is not a Native route; pause continuity unresolved. UNKNOWN pending TUNER/O13. |
| `playback.pause {}` | Explicit pause, declared connection/decoder/buffer side effects, coherent observed PAUSED with current context and correlation. | Existing TUNER PAUSED stops decoding despite old mute-only comment; no timeshift promise or toggle substitution. O13; refuse unverified mapping. |
| `playback.stop {}` | Explicit teardown/stop side effects and completion evidence distinct from transport receipt; no inference that disconnected device is stopped/off. | Core foundation supports; HOME does not install stop descriptor. TUNER internal stop exists, no Native command. UNKNOWN/O13. |
| Station activation (`content.launch` REFERENCE candidate, or separately reviewed station role) | Durable item/catalog identity, exact codec, execution-time conditional/stable selection guard and truthful resulting media context. Raw URL stays private where needed. | Station role OPEN O07/O14. Mutable index/name/URL cannot supply SelectionRef proof. content.launch descriptor blocked by Core operation slice; ingress reference payload absent. Both prerequisites; do not coerce to source/channel. |
| `favorites.enumerate` / `favorites.activate` DEVICE_NATIVE | TUNER-owned authoritative list, complete/partial evidence, stable IDs/catalog guard and correlated activation. | TUNER stores10 favorites but existing web provides positions only/no activation. Core executable Favorite/enumeration slice missing. No REMOTE duplicate station DB. Both; O07/O09/O14. |
| Saved listing / optional Recent | Reviewed source/channel/content catalog representation, durable IDs and guarded activation; truthful Recent attempt-versus-success semantics. | No generic 'Recent' common operation invented. Existing Recent is5-entry discovered-attempt MRU; optional scope OPEN O09/O14. Source/Favorite/content mapping depends on reviewed role. |
| `volume.set {level: Rational[0,1]}` | Verified actual domain/resolution and exact reject/quantize/error/inverse rules; absolute0..100 may map by100 only after descriptor proof; execution reports actual value separately. | Core numeric slice accepts normalized percent-exact grid or two-point synthetic table; does not map to external integer0..100 generally. HOME has no writable volume intent. TUNER underflow B06 prerequisite. Both/O11/O12; unavailable until proper reviewed mapping. |
| `source.enumerate` / `source.select` | Independent guarded source catalog and verified identity/state; RADIO/BT availability is not playback confirmation. | source.select foundation exists, enumeration executable slice/ingress references/real source mapping absent. O08/O14. Do not infer station is source. |
| Optional `playback.next/previous` | Genuine traversal in captured context, safe empty list, stale guard and declared ordering; no Favorite mutation disguised as next. | Mock traversal is not proof. Saved wrap/discovered Next=add-favorite/BT AVRCP differ. O07/O08/O14; unknown/unavailable by context. |
| Optional metadata / artwork reads | Independent readable fields and context-safe asset evidence; no mutation needed to render known observations. | No artwork fetch/cache or asset ingress; richer pipeline separately scoped/O15, must not block independent verified controls. |
| Unsupported optional BT/search/power/seek/etc. | Negotiate independent actual capabilities, truthful absent reasons; no emission-as-state or fabricated media duration. | Not part of proposed mandatory subset. BT toggles not explicit operations; browse/search optional/O08/O09. TUNER power.set cannot mean REMOTE power policy. |
| Any admitted command/result/retry | Immutable correlated key/envelope, execution-time auth/context guard, bounded history, deadlines not compared across clocks, dedup and no blind reconnect replay. | Core hook/one attempt exists; target ledger/security/retention absent and client durable journal missing. Both/O05/O10/O12/O16/O17. New retry requires separately verified past/future evidence. |

## 4. Incoming mapping ? TUNER observation/result to CCM evidence

| Native input | Required normalization / proof | Baseline and safe handling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Device/API/capability data | Registry IDs, binding/mapping evidence and supported subset; separate authorization/reachability and version negotiations. | Internal functions cannot earn SUPPORTED/READY; Native advertisement absent. O03/O05/O12. |
| Connectivity/availability | Verified link and authorized binding reachability distinct from stream/internet/source readiness. | TUNER cached Wi-Fi/IP can stale (B05); use no synthetic reachability or device power assumption. Missing proof remains UNKNOWN. |
| Playback/source state | Observed enum semantics in coherent media context, acquisition age/sequence and confidence/provenance. Not UI mode/last request. `NOT_PLAYING` does not imply stopped. | TUNER failed play/BT optimistic PLAYING undermine truth (B07/B09); mixed UI/audio station state. Unknown rather than a false success; O12/O13. |
| Actual volume | Validate numeric domain and inverse representability to normalized reduced Rational, report actual precision; no requested-value echo as observation. | Current TUNER getter lacks uniform writer synchronization; new copied snapshot needed (B08). Domain mapping not arbitrary clamp. O12. |
| Current media/title/artist/codec | Native coherent context identity -> Core-controlled media generation before field publication; bind old acquisition scope; codec remains truthful Native/private data unless typed reviewed extension. | Generic ingress admits scalar strings but cannot prove media coherence. Metadata supports present/absent; no native codec common field invented. B03/B07/B08; O12/O14. |
| Source/content/current Favorite references | Durable item continuity and current catalog scopes -> common SelectionRef; complete versus partial merge rules and guarded target selection. Native revision is evidence, not common catalog_generation. | Catalog/Core types exist; reference/asset ingress absent. No positional-ID coercion, no unsafe reference field publication. O07/O14. |
| Favorite membership / Recent | Independently negotiated Native metadata/catalog info with reviewed typed mapping; keep DEVICE_NATIVE separate from REMOTE_RECIPE. | No frozen 'favorite boolean' or Recent field invented. Unknown if unmapped; TUNER persists, REMOTE does not duplicate DB. O09/O14. |
| Artwork/stream locator | Private credential-safe locator plus verified device/session/media/asset identity; REMOTE owns lookup/cache and discards stale completion. | Legacy stream_url diagnostic may leak credentials; no URL in common UI strings. Asset ingress/fetch absent; O15/O17. |
| Snapshot/event freshness and gap | Verified causal acquisition sequence/domain plus bounded acquisition age; local receipt includes queue delay. Same old cached snapshot/nonce cannot renew freshness. | Core/ingress verified-sequence slice only; no serial-query profile implemented. Gap/new incarnation triggers resync, not arrival-order repair. O02/O12. |
| Accepted/admitted result | Correlate original immutable request/attempt/mapping/session; admission/emission/delivery separate from completed target outcome. | Existing HTTP201 persistence response is not playback completion; no Native correlation. Never fabricate COMPLETE from HTTP success. O10. |
| Completion/partial/failure | Exact supported operation/unit extent, evidence identity/provenance, actual progress and error; preserve delivery and partial lower bounds. | Ingress Result bounded claims/keys and simple error detail; nested cause/step proof unsupported by pack profile. Unknown execution remains uncertain; delayed completion schedules nothing. |
| No-execution/fence proof | Past AND future absence needed for retry safety on all affected keys; future-only proof releases only covered future barriers, not past-execution history. | Core machinery exists in local tests/Mock, not target implementation. No inference from timeout/readback/new session. O10/O12. |
| Old-session late response | Reject as current sample; allow historical effect resolution only through current safe delivery scope and original inner immutable attempt correlation. Purged full result is not recreated. | Generic Boundary checks outer current scope while Core evidence retains inner old session. A transport must normalize safely, never restamp stale observation. O10/O12. |
| Native reboot/DHCP/version/capability withdrawal | Reverify stable identity, invalidate scoped state/unsent selection, reacquire fresh complete facts; preserve barriers/history without replay. | Existing Mock reconnect increments local session; actual Native incarnation mapping absent. Native counters never replace local generations. Both/O02/O03/O10/O12. |

## 5. Durable recovery prerequisites ? distinct from product settings

Source confirms `Journal::commit(Store)` hook, persist failure -> blocked, effects/attempt reservation and ambiguous-delivery commit before Adapter.dispatch. `MockJournal::commit` only increments a count/returns writable; it serializes/writes nothing. Session Store is rebuilt on physical boot. A different random epoch is not verified lifetime ID non-reuse. Synthetic restart keeps caller-owned Store only within one process; light sleep retains RAM but cold reset does not.

Before real executable handover, separately scope and verify:

1. Persistent identity/generation and lifetime request-ID allocation/non-reuse, checked exhaustion and atomic commit before sending.
2. Recoverable immutable request/attempt/context correlation, target/resource historical barrier keys, progress/emission lower bounds and unresolved past/future extent.
3. Crash-consistent bounded journal format/version/migration, interrupted-write/corruption/failure behavior; unknown recovery blocks affected paths pending verified reconciliation/fencing, never replay.
4. Old epochs abandon unsent scheduling, not historical effects. Full-result retention purge must not purge independent unresolved barrier decision state.
5. Separate association/authorization durability and reset erase rules; changing current association cannot remove old physical effect keys.
6. Physical reboot/power-cut fault evidence after a separately approved implementation. Current NVS Wi-Fi settings and RTC POWER reset history provide none of these Core guarantees.

No persistence design/storage medium/format is selected. O10/O16 dependencies require both device review and owner approval where shared. Implementing a journal alone cannot manufacture target-side ledger/context/fence guarantees.

## 6. Sleep and hardware evidence reconciliation

Current source `power_management/model.cpp::Machine::tick` ignores external-power state for sleep eligibility;30s display idle/300s total system idle. Runtime checks wake readiness/battery validity/hold and NETWORK preparation; pending/uncertain Mock effects block owner park. `network_manager/runtime.cpp::sleep_stop/start` seals input, revokes/quiesces diagnostics, stops portal HTTP/DNS, stops Wi-Fi and fences old driver events; resume restarts saved STA without credential writes. Core boundary closes/discards queued work; reattach increments local incarnation/session, restores captured capability/reachability and acquires fresh synthetic data. This is not real TUNER recovery verification.

Normal light sleep disables timer wake; development forced Z retains2s fallback. GPIO8 level wake remains shared touch/motion; first touch consumed, motion wake emits no playback intent. ADC1 and separate GPIO4/GPIO1 calibration handles stay allocated across sleep; no ADC teardown/recreate calls remain in Board/runtime. No deep sleep/automatic hard-off or new policy change.

| Dated evidence | Exact scope / current classification |
| --- | --- |
| 2026-10-05/06 sleep owner records | Motion wake PASS; touch wake -> first touch consumed -> second normal -> NETWORK/diagnostics recovery PASS. Preserve recorded scope; no invented counts/current-artifact badge. |
| GPIO1 owner acceptance2026-10-06 | Installed100k/100k GPIO1 USB connected/disconnected/reconnect/icon PASS; charging remains UNKNOWN. Source's PROVISIONAL log text and older roadmap PENDING do not erase later owner acceptance. |
| Accepted whole-device baseline | Battery4.075V:120mA display100%,90mA50%,about70mA display-off/system-active,about23mA normal sleep stable~5min; no SD. Does not attribute rail currents. |
| ADC optimization artifact | BIN `b4580e6a?`: OWNER HARDWARE FAIL for residency; immediate uncommanded wake. Causality NOT PROVEN. |
| Recorded rollback control | BIN `d2938335?` / ELF `7fece2e8?`: historical software300/0/550686 normal and300/0/5283936 soak, clean build reported; owner hardware residency PENDING. No newer control PASS found in live documentation or supplied session evidence. |
| Current local artifacts | Different hashes listed in section1. Provenance/flashed identity UNKNOWN, no inherited software or owner residency PASS. |
| Earlier Stage2B.2 closure | Covered publication-frame/wake paths owner PASS, latest run1256B; earlier1248B remains historical lowest from another run. Review target1024B is not safety guarantee. Prior IMU_WOM0 incident real/not reproduced/root cause unknown. |

Historical Stage1 ledger remains OPEN, separate from today's earlier Step1 closure. Network Settings backend hardware remains blocked by missing UI/harness, not FAIL. This task does not reopen, test or correct POWER/NETWORK. Sleep requires future Native session/state reacquisition and cannot simply restore saved synthetic reachability for a real target.

## 7. Reconciliation findings and bounded follow-up proposals

| Finding | Responsible actor / dependency | Recommended next scope / gate, not authorization |
| --- | --- | --- |
| F01 Frozen reference/provenance missing in shared index | PM reference acceptance; recovered this report | Review/pin copied frozen hash and original approval excerpt; update PM-owned register separately, no model rewrite. |
| F02 Core journal synthetic and ID counter boot-local | REMOTE; O10/O16 | Design bounded durable foundation/recovery with fault vectors before real handover. Storage choice/implementation separately scoped. |
| F03 Minimum Favorite/content listing/activation exceeds executable slice | REMOTE; O07/O09/O14 | Review measured reference/catalog ingress and exact operation subset extension against existing frozen schemas. No new protocol here. |
| F04 TUNER0..100 mapping not accepted by synthetic numeric profile | REMOTE/TUNER; O11/O12 | Define exact representability/domain/inverse evidence and bounded mapping extension. Do not use presentation rounding as adapter logic. |
| F05 Native truth/context/guards/results unavailable | TUNER; O07/O10/O12/O13/O14 | Await A-TUNER-001 correctness/state foundation proposal and target-side proof; no playback routes bolted onto getters. |
| F06 Legacy wire/security preferences not approvals | Both/owner; O01?O06/O17 | Evaluate measured bindings/security/association/coexistence; reviewed shared proposal before implementation/freeze. |
| F07 Current BIN differs from recorded rollback | Owner/REMOTE evidence | Obtain actually flashed hash/current owner control result or artifact build provenance in separately authorized verification; no speculative attribution. |
| F08 Sleep reference statuses are dated/inconsistent | PM evidence reconciliation | Prefer later source/owner records with artifact scope, retain pending rollback; no broad doc cleanup or POWER fix in this task. |

### Questions/recommendations for every OPEN decision

| ID | REMOTE finding / question to TUNER or PM |
| --- | --- |
| O01 | Which measured binding/serialization fits target SDK4.4.7 and client bounded ingress? HTTP exists, playback API absent; do not freeze REST/JSON/WS/HTTPS from candidate. |
| O02 | Provide sequence/gap/full-snapshot/acquisition-age guarantees; client currently supports verified-sequence scalar ingestion, not nonce-only freshness. |
| O03 | Define stable verified Native identity continuity; map to persistent Core registry IDs without copying MAC fragments/IP. |
| O04 | Review service/TXT/expiry/multi-unit profile; mDNS direction is decided, advertisement not implemented. |
| O05 | Define deliberate bootstrap, grant/revocation and sleep/reboot recovery; association setting is not authorization proof. |
| O06 | Select reviewed API binding paths/ports alongside provisioning; current port80 routes do not select Native layout. |
| O07 | Supply durable item/codec/duplicate/reorder/delete identity and execution guard; array positions are insufficient. |
| O08 | Explicitly decide optional BT scope based on observed feedback, not optimistic AVRCP toggle. |
| O09 | Confirm conservative saved/Favorite subset and optional Recent/search/mutations; unavailable actions cannot fill UI slots. |
| O10 | Review server bounded dedup/result/past-future ledger guarantees plus client durable recovery; do not import Core quotas as target limits. |
| O11 | TUNER measures audio/TLS/BT/socket/body/history/stack envelope; REMOTE measures added payload/journal allocations only when implementation authorized. |
| O12 | Define causal coherent snapshot/incarnation/freshness; target revisions are not Core generation counters. |
| O13 | Resolve truthful radio pause/resume/stop semantics and failed-play behavior; no timeshift or audible-success inference. |
| O14 | Review station content/channel/source role, traversal/resource guards and Recent attempts; explicit Favorite action separate from next. |
| O15 | Provide privacy-safe media locator/context; REMOTE owns artwork; asset ingress/pipeline separately scoped, controls independent of artwork absence. |
| O16 | Review reset domains and crash recovery for identity/grants/catalogs/association/Core effect history; Wi-Fi reset not factory reset. |
| O17 | Native auth/replay/transport/legacy-route policy cannot inherit unauthenticated web behavior or REMOTE LAN OTA access policy. |

All remain OPEN. TUNER resource-sensitive decisions cannot be closed from REMOTE inspection. Native API remains UNAPPROVED/UNFROZEN/NOT IMPLEMENTED. The canonical handoff's section22 checklist remains future acceptance, not completed work.

## 8. Verification and review disposition

Read-only source/config/header and artifact parsing; recovered original approval and exact section comparison; entry/post hashes; copied-evidence integrity; documentation links; handoff template headings; archive byte identity; git diff whitespace/scope and remote publication readback. Exact commands/results are in the evidence records. No tests/build/uploads/hardware run; historical counts retain exact scope/date and do not apply to unmatched artifacts.

Inspection deliverables are READY FOR REVIEW. Dependencies preventing real adapter implementation/full model conformance remain explicit (durability, missing reference/catalog ingress and operations, numeric profile, target truth/security/guards and OPEN decisions). They do not prevent completion of this inspection assignment. PM reviews both devices and alone coordinates the shared gate; owner approval remains separate. No firmware commit exists in this Git-less workspace.
