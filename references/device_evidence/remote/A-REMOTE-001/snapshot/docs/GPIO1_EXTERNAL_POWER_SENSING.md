# GPIO1 external-power sensing - 2026-10-06

## Current owner acceptance - 2026-10-06

**OWNER HARDWARE VALIDATED / PASS**: GPIO1 ADC / binary thresholds / screen-2 battery-to-USB icon switching for the installed100kOhm/100kOhm GPIO1 circuit and current firmware. USB connected, USB disconnected and reconnect cycles all PASS. Charging remains UNKNOWN as designed. The600/1800mV thresholds and existing debounce are accepted for this tested circuit/firmware; this is not a universal ADC accuracy/noise specification. No new numeric runtime raw/mV values were supplied in this closure. Firmware diagnostics still say `thresholds=PROVISIONAL`; this is the unchanged implementation label, superseded as an acceptance status by this owner decision. No firmware label or threshold was changed.

**Sleep regression on the GPIO1 firmware: OWNER HARDWARE VALIDATED / PASS.** Automatic SYSTEM_SLEEP entered at approximately302s; touch wake, display recovery, Wi-Fi reconnect and browser diagnostics recovery PASS. No reset/WDT/blocking regression was observed.

**Accepted whole-device hardware power baseline at battery4.075V:** display ON/100%120mA; display ON/50%90mA; display OFF/system active approximately70mA with rare approximately80mA peaks; normal SYSTEM_SLEEP approximately23mA, approximately stable during about5minutes of observation. No SD card was fitted. These owner measurements do not identify individual component/rail currents or prove the source of23mA. Fine-pitch/per-rail physical probing: **NOT REQUIRED / OWNER DECLINED for this milestone**, not failed validation. [Current baseline/audit and future optimization limits](SYSTEM_SLEEP_CURRENT_AUDIT.md).

This supersedes the ADC/threshold/icon and sleep-regression pending wording in the original implementation record/procedure below; those records are preserved as history. Unreported physical stack-watermark/dynamic-memory measurements and broader historical Stage1 evidence gaps are not promoted by this acceptance. Deep sleep remains a future design/optimization task, NOT IMPLEMENTED / NOT ACCEPTED. Documentation only; no firmware/build/upload.

## Historical implementation checkpoint - pending status superseded above

IMPLEMENTED / FULL HOST REGRESSION + SOAK + CLEAN BUILD PASS / OWNER ADC + THRESHOLD + ICON HARDWARE VALIDATION PENDING. Owner divider wiring/voltage measurements are evidence; firmware acquisition/classification/rendering are not yet hardware-validated. No upload. Historical Stage1 remains OPEN; accepted SYSTEM_SLEEP motion/touch/NETWORK-recovery evidence is preserved.

## Exact owner hardware evidence

Board: Waveshare ESP32-S3-Touch-LCD-3.49 V2 Rev1.1. Source is PTH `5V`, with100kOhm from PTH5V to ADC node and100kOhm from node to PTH `G`; node wired to GPIO1.

| Measurement | USB disconnected | USB connected |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| PTH5V to PTHG |0.00V|approximately4.95V|
| GPIO1/node to PTHG |0.00V|approximately2.42V|

Owner measurements, not calculated divider values or host predictions. GPIO4 remains the existing battery ADC. An ideal equal-resistor ratio does not replace the measured node voltage. Firmware reports node millivolts without multiplying by2 or declaring a calibrated VBUS voltage. GPIO1 availability/wiring is now owner-evidenced; the prior unallocated-pin inventory is superseded for GPIO1 only.

## Audit and implementation

Pinned ESP-IDF5.5.3 ESP32-S3 mapping: GPIO1=ADC1 channel0, GPIO4=ADC1 channel3, checked through SDK soc/adc_channel.h and target static assertion. ADC1 is already allocated once by POWER; use a second independently configured channel on that unit, not ADC2 or a second ADC1 owner. [Pinned oneshot documentation](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v5.5.3/esp32s3/api-reference/peripherals/adc_oneshot.html) supports separately configured channels. [Pinned calibration documentation](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v5.5.3/esp32s3/api-reference/peripherals/adc_calibration.html) and installed curve-fitting implementation establish calibration support/failure behavior.

GPIO1 explicitly uses ADC_ATTEN_DB_12, ADC_BITWIDTH_12 and its own channel0 curve-fitting handle. The S3's nominal12dB measurement range extends to3100mV, enclosing the measured2420mV; lower attenuation does not provide that same coverage. [Espressif range guidance](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-faq/en/latest/software-framework/peripherals/adc.html). This is range suitability, not proof of runtime accuracy on the installed100k/100k divider. Calibration is required; no guessed reference/default linear conversion fallback. The additional initialization runs after unchanged WoM configuration/summary, so no new pre-WoM timing/delay/retry is introduced.

Existing GPIO4 battery acquisition is byte-preserved: ADC1 ch3,12dB,12bits, independent original curve-fitting handle, four reads/rounded mean, calibrated node voltage multiplied by3 for its original schematic divider. No battery threshold/filter/qualification change. External setup/calibration failures do not change battery readiness, WoM readiness or sleep eligibility. If the shared ADC1 unit itself is unavailable, both measurements naturally cannot read; external reports UNKNOWN/unit-unavailable error.

POWER's existing awake2s ADC cadence acquires four bounded GPIO1 reads and rounded mean, then converts with channel0 calibration. Raw saturation4095, invalid raw values, negative/out-of-range conversion or SDK failure produce invalid/UNKNOWN. Zero raw and zero calibrated millivolts are valid external measurements, distinct from the battery path's positive-voltage requirement. Initialization error/read/calibration/range error exposed; on failed conversion mv0 denotes unavailable, not a confirmed ABSENT. Saturated offending raw is retained for diagnostics. No repeated sampling task, queue, new interrupt, GPIO8 change or I2C/WoM change.

### Original provisional binary policy - hardware acceptance superseded above

Thresholds are node voltage: ABSENT candidate<=600mV; PRESENT candidate>=1800mV. They approximate the lower/upper quarters of the measured0..2420mV separation, allowing a broad1200mV hysteresis band and about620mV margin below the measured connected node. They are not a5V supply compliance/battery/charging threshold. Both are explicitly PROVISIONAL pending actual firmware ADC distributions and physical comparison.

Three consecutive qualifying samples are needed at the existing2s cadence:4s between first and third, normally within6s of a physical change. A contrary sample resets confirmation. Within600..1800mV, retain the last confirmed state; boot/invalid history with only intermediate readings stays UNKNOWN. Any invalid/calibration failure immediately sets UNKNOWN and resets confirmation; recovery needs three fresh qualifying samples. A sampling gap>4s or time regression invalidates the historical decision before new confirmation, so sleep/wake cannot indefinitely retain a stale plugged-in indication. Sampling is paused by existing SYSTEM_SLEEP and resumes on wake; this is cached sampled telemetry, not USB-event/wake-source sensing.

State/error counter storage is bounded, counter saturates. Detector state is fixed POWER-owned storage, not a persistent outer-task stack-local copy or heap object. Copied read-only ExternalView is published through the existing short POWER view critical section; UI performs no ADC/SDK conversion. Separate external state is not copied into Battery.external and does not alter critical-shutdown semantics. Existing SYSTEM_SLEEP eligibility call and NETWORK prepare/resume implementation remain unchanged. Charging remains UNKNOWN for every state, including PRESENT. Existing automatic hard-off prohibition/hold behavior and manual development controls remain unchanged; the battery transition log now labels inhibition POLICY_UNCHANGED instead of attributing it to missing external sensing.

### Diagnostics

Serial `B` retains existing reports and adds:

`EXTERNAL_POWER: gpio=1 raw=<ADC> mv=<node_mV> valid=<0|1> calibrated=<0|1> error=<esp_err_t> read_errors=<count> external=<PRESENT|ABSENT|UNKNOWN> charging=UNKNOWN thresholds=PROVISIONAL`

One boot summary identifies GPIO1/ADC1_CH0/12dB/12bits, calibration initialization/error and provisional thresholds/cadence. No per-read log spam. Browser `/api/status` adds to `power`: external_raw, external_mv, external_valid, external_calibrated, external_error, external_read_errors; existing external becomes the published state string. Existing charging UNKNOWN, battery fields,23-entry value ordering, RTC reset history, routes/access control and bounded response remain unchanged. Invalid/error/uncalibrated snapshots cannot display PRESENT. No new persistent writes.

### Screen2 icon

Inspection found a battery outline at104,13 with tip117,15 and no pre-existing plugged-in object. Owner clarified: switch that battery icon to a usual plugged-in icon when USB is present. Implemented existing LV_SYMBOL_USB/U+F287 from already-enabled Montserrat12; no new library/font/asset. The glyph's existing bitmap is16px wide/11px high, advance15px, font line-height15px: plug label104,10,width16,height15. Fits wholly inside172x640, ends at120 with2px clearance before unchanged voltage text at122; ends at25 above divider32. No glyph clipping; battery outline/tip geometry retained.

PRESENT + valid/calibrated/error0 hides battery body/tip and shows USB glyph. ABSENT or UNKNOWN/error hides USB glyph and restores existing battery outline. Same primary color/font, voltage formatting, screen layout/carousel/touch remain unchanged. Binding runs before Core snapshot generation early-return, so external transitions render even without Mock/Core presentation changes. A USB-presence glyph is not a charging claim. Owner must verify its physical appearance and state changes.

GPIO4 battery acquisition function byte-preserved against entry copy; NETWORK sleep/resume, power model.cpp/thresholds, GPIO8/wake/WoM, RTC reset format/storage, partitions/configuration, frozen Core/CCM and other UI geometry unchanged. Source hash/diff audit:16 modified existing files +4 added, zero deleted (20 total); all other non-build files unchanged. .pio outputs are expected clean-build artifacts.

Host evidence cannot verify high-impedance divider loading, target ADC calibration accuracy/noise, physical node wiring or symbol appearance. No runtime firmware threshold/accuracy acceptance is inferred from the multimeter-only owner measurements. Actual sleep/wake, stack and memory behavior require remeasurement for the new artifact.

## Historical first owner validation procedure - completed owner results above

1. Owner-controlled flash this artifact only, retaining current partitions/NVS/credentials; no erase. Battery stays connected, boot by USB, never inaccessible PWR. Wait>=8s. Capture boot external calibration/error line and `B`. Expected calibrated1/error0; external valid1; measured ADC-node mv approximately2420 (record actual raw/mV and difference from contemporaneous multimeter), external PRESENT after three samples. Screen2 voltage remains battery voltage; USB glyph replaces battery outline. Charging UNKNOWN; automatic_system_sleep=ENABLED/external_gate=NONE. Unexpected error/UNKNOWN, saturation, unstable readings or material measurement discrepancy: report raw/mV/error and do not call thresholds validated.
2. Use `W`/HOME to find current STA IP; open `http://<STA-IP>/api/status` or existing browser diagnostics. While USB-connected record all external fields after>=8s, cross-check contemporaneous GPIO1/node and PTH5V voltages. The formerapproximately2.42/4.95V are owner baseline references, not fabricated runtime readings.
3. Disconnect USB while battery remains attached and SYS_EN holds. Serial will be unavailable, so keep using the same LAN browser. Within8s, expected valid1/calibrated1/error0, node mv approximately0 (a small ADC floor must be recorded, not hidden), external ABSENT after confirmation; screen2 restores battery outline. Re-measure node/PTH5V to PTHG, compare raw/calibrated values with physical0.00V; no reboot/credential loss expected. A0mV value with valid0 is UNKNOWN/error, not ABSENT PASS.
4. Reconnect USB without rebooting: after8s expect stable node near2420mV, PRESENT and USB glyph, charging UNKNOWN. Reattach serial monitor115200 if required and capture `B`/`S`/`W`. Repeat at least5 connect/disconnect cycles; record transitions, node/ADC differences, saturation/read errors, icon correspondence and boot/uptime continuity. Brief/intermediate readings must not rapidly toggle the icon. Do not deliberately short the ADC/5V or alter installed resistors for error injection; UNKNOWN/failure paths are host-tested.
5. Only after both states' actual ADC distributions/physical comparison and transitions are accepted by the owner may600/1800mV thresholds be marked HARDWARE VALIDATED for this circuit. If readings disagree, keep PROVISIONAL and investigate before adjustment; do not merely lower thresholds to hide acquisition problems. Record actual measurements/error/noise and tested conditions; no universal precision/specification claim.
6. Regression: leave untouched300s on USB and again on battery. Normal sleep must remain independent of PRESENT/ABSENT; motion wake and first-touch-consumed/second-touch-normal plus NETWORK/browser recovery must still pass, no2s normal wake cadence/hard-off/PWR requirement. After long sleep, UNKNOWN/battery outline while fresh three-sample confirmation occurs is intentional. Check POWER S/B and NETWORK W stack/allocation/error telemetry. Historical system-sleep PASS is preserved, not substituted for this artifact's retest. No battery deep-discharge experiment is needed.

PASS requires physically consistent calibrated readings/valid states, stable debounced transitions and correct icon in both USB states; charging UNKNOWN and no protected-behavior regression. UNKNOWN/error or disagreement remains a reported failure/investigation, not an invented hardware PASS. Existing independent battery-accuracy/endurance and historical Stage1 evidence gaps remain separate.
