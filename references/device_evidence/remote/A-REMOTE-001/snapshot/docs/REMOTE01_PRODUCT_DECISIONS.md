# REMOTE//01 canonical product decision register

> **Current evidence supplement ? 2026-10-07:** [canonical TUNER requirements handoff](TUNER_REQUIREMENTS_FROM_REMOTE.md) records the separate TUNER main `371cdebce7ba2648ea71636d5bdb5d738b42e680` / v1.1.0 audit. Earlier unrecovered actual-TUNER implementation classifications are superseded for audited internal audio/catalog/Wi-Fi/HTTP behavior only. Native playback API, discovery, association, stable IDs, revisions and correlation remain absent; final Native transport/security/identity representation remain OPEN. Existing product ownership decisions are preserved: standalone direct control, optional HA/openHAB, TUNER station/Favorites/Recent storage and REMOTE artwork. This supplement neither freezes the API nor authorizes implementation.

2026-10-05 - Today's Step2 owner-approved reconciliation. Authority: explicit owner request in attachment86e54181-6a73-4328-ab6e-ba3384067b6c/Pasted text.txt, sections A-I. This register supersedes conflicting current product classifications in older audits/proposals; it does not rewrite historical evidence or grant implementation/hardware acceptance.

Statuses: DECIDED; DESIGN REQUIRED; IMPLEMENTATION + HARDWARE VALIDATION REQUIRED; SUPERSEDED; EXCLUDED; UNKNOWN / NOT RECOVERED. Owner wording OPEN / DESIGN REQUIRED is normalized to DESIGN REQUIRED; EXCLUDED / DECIDED to EXCLUDED (explicit owner decision). Historical suggestions remain historical, not a seventh current status.

| Owner item | Status | Exact canonical scope / boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
|1|**DECIDED**|REMOTE//01 and TUNER//01 are physically separate devices.|
|2|**DECIDED**|TUNER owns internet-radio streaming, decoding, playback and audio output; REMOTE does not locally decode/play internet radio.|
|3|**DECIDED**|REMOTE finds artwork for the active stream URL, retrieves/caches it and displays a thumbnail while that media/URL context is active; obsolete results cannot replace current artwork.|
|4|**DECIDED**|Dormant REMOTE codec/audio BSP is not used for internet-radio playback; it may remain excluded until cleanup and is hardware inventory only.|
|5|**DECIDED**|REMOTE is designed primarily for TUNER, retaining protocol-neutral model/adapter boundaries for Home Assistant and openHAB compatibility. Product positioning is not generic-first or TUNER-independent.|
|6|**DECIDED**|TUNER Native is primary/first native target. Home Assistant/openHAB are intended compatibility integrations. Matter/Smart-TV/IR retain historical/intended direction without priority over TUNER Native or support claims.|
|7|**DECIDED**|Home Assistant/openHAB are optional integrations, not mandatory hubs or the architectural center.|
|8|**EXCLUDED**|Zigbee is explicitly excluded by owner decision; not UNKNOWN / NOT RECOVERED.|
|9|**SUPERSEDED**|Local-versus-external playback selection gates and active REMOTE local-radio streaming/decoder/I2S/audio-output workstreams are outside current product scope. Historical comparisons retained only as superseded.|
|10|**DECIDED**|Use mDNS for TUNER discovery; manual IP/hostname fallback may remain. No service name/port/identity hints are approved by this decision.|
|11|**UNKNOWN / NOT RECOVERED**|Actual TUNER wire protocol not recovered/verified; existing Native API candidate remains unapproved/unfrozen.|
|12|**DESIGN REQUIRED**|Select transport after actual TUNER source/capabilities/protocol verification; do not freeze WebSocket + HTTPS.|
|13|**DECIDED**|User-accessible Network Settings/reprovisioning for router/network/location changes, showing current IP/status.|
|14|**DECIDED**|Wi-Fi credential reset and general/factory reset remain separate operations.|
|15|**DESIGN REQUIRED**|Define exact general/factory erase scope and retention policy.|
|16|**DECIDED**|Development/Mock UI is temporary; approved production UI replaces it.|
|17|**DESIGN REQUIRED**|Finalize production navigation/focus/settings/reset/media flows.|
|18|**DECIDED**|One rotary encoder plus three physical buttons.|
|19|**IMPLEMENTATION + HARDWARE VALIDATION REQUIRED**|Implement/verify GPIO mapping, encoder A/B, push presence/pin if used, button pins, active levels/pulls/electrical levels, detents/pulses and physical CW/CCW; invent no assignments.|
|20|**DESIGN REQUIRED**|Explicitly design/freeze encoder CW/CCW, push if present, three button meanings, screen/focus behavior, short/long presses if used and control-specific wake; do not claim actions were never approved.|
|21|**DECIDED**|Motion wakes only without control/playback intent; first asleep-display touch wakes only, subsequent touch operates; normal recovery cannot depend on inaccessible PWR.|
|22|**DECIDED**|Automatic SYSTEM_SLEEP is independent of external-power state: PRESENT, ABSENT and UNKNOWN are all eligible with other safety/coordination prerequisites. Supersedes earlier external-power eligibility gate. Normal SYSTEM_SLEEP quiesces NETWORK/Wi-Fi before light sleep and restores them after wake; separately authorized implementation and verification recorded in [sleep/network report](SYSTEM_SLEEP_NETWORK_IMPLEMENTATION.md), OWNER HARDWARE VALIDATION PASS for motion wake and the touch-wake/first-contact-consumption/second-contact-normal/NETWORK-diagnostics-recovery path (2026-10-06); other unreported checks PENDING.|
|23|**DECIDED**|External sensing uses owner-installed100kOhm/100kOhm divider from PTH5V to PTHG, ADC node GPIO1 (ADC1_CH0); measured source/node0.00V/0.00V disconnected andapproximately4.95V/2.42V connected. Separate calibrated POWER acquisition and screen2 USB-presence icon implemented; firmware readings/provisional600/1800mV thresholds/icon hardware validation PENDING. Presence only, charging UNKNOWN; automatic SYSTEM_SLEEP remains external-independent. [Evidence](GPIO1_EXTERNAL_POWER_SENSING.md).|
|24|**DECIDED**|SD purpose: keep a firmware backup before flashing/updating.|
|25|**SUPERSEDED**|SD-purpose OWNER DECISION REQUIRED and UNKNOWN / NOT RECOVERED classifications superseded by decision24; do not carry them as current status.|
|26|**SUPERSEDED**|SD staging/SD OTA suggestions are not canonical SD purpose; retained historical proposals only, not required or implemented paths.|
|27|**IMPLEMENTATION + HARDWARE VALIDATION REQUIRED**|Verify routing/card detect/power; implement bounded mount/unmount/I/O/removal/error handling separately from decided purpose.|
|28|**DECIDED**|Persistence: favorites/recent stations -> TUNER; Wi-Fi credentials/settings, REMOTE UI settings, last associated TUNER and artwork cache -> REMOTE.|
|29|**DECIDED**|REMOTE does not persist station database/favorites; reads TUNER favorites for presentation/selection; TUNER executes playback.|
|30|**DECIDED**|Station/favorites persistence capacity/lifetime on REMOTE is not a product requirement. TUNER-side limits remain outside this repository unless verified target evidence is available.|
|31|**DESIGN REQUIRED**|Define survival/erasure for Wi-Fi reset, factory reset, UI settings, last associated TUNER, artwork cache and local service state. Ownership does not select reset scope.|
|32|**DECIDED**|REMOTE owns complete artwork lookup/discovery, retrieval/download, cache and display function.|
|33|**DECIDED**|Bind artwork to current URL/media context; discard late results from obsolete context.|
|34|**DESIGN REQUIRED**|Artwork lookup sources/mechanism, formats, dimensions/bytes, timeout, redirects/errors, decode policy, cache size/eviction/lifetime and absent-artwork fallback.|
|35|**DECIDED**|OTA required; accepted16MiB factory + otadata + ota_0 + ota_1 infrastructure remains unchanged.|
|36|**DECIDED**|OTA allowed from same local network without password authentication. Supersedes earlier authentication-required/LAN-insufficient OTA access requirement; no upload implementation authorized here. This does not change Wi-Fi provisioning security or TUNER control authentication.|
|37|**DECIDED**|Before flashing/updating, write a firmware backup to SD. Requirement is not currently implemented/validated; no claim earlier uploads created such a backup.|
|38|**DESIGN REQUIRED**|OTA image identity/compatibility, downgrade policy, interruption behavior, trial boot/health confirmation, rollback and relationship between factory/ota_0/ota_1/SD backup. Access policy does not select image trust/signature policy.|

## Frozen model versus product policy

Frozen CCM remains unchanged: context/asset safety, logical DEVICE_NATIVE versus REMOTE_RECIPE semantics, identity/session/authorization, evidence and durable command-history/barrier rules continue to apply to supported operations. Supporting logical favorite variants does not require this product to persist a REMOTE station/favorite database. Product chooses TUNER-owned station/favorite persistence; mandatory Core command-history persistence is a separate model concern, not station persistence. No direct frozen-CCM contradiction found. OTA access policy is outside CCM control-command authorization and does not weaken TUNER binding verification.

## Implementation and acceptance boundaries

Decisions are not implementation proof. Current SD backup, artwork pipeline, external5V divider sensing, integrated physical inputs and OTA writer/transfer/trial/rollback are not claimed implemented or owner-validated. No pin/resistor/image format/cache quota/erase-domain/protocol choice is invented. Same-LAN OTA access and image trust/compatibility are separate concerns; remaining trust/recovery design must follow the decided no-password access policy.

Today's Step1 remains CLOSED / OWNER HARDWARE VALIDATION PASS for reported running checks; Stage2B.2 closed for covered paths. Broader historical Stage1 remains OPEN for existing evidence gaps. Network Settings backend physical validation remains BLOCKED BY DESIGN / MISSING USER-ACCESSIBLE UI OR HARNESS, not FAIL; OPEN_SETUP/CANCEL/confirmed Wi-Fi reset not claimed owner-tested. WoM prior incident remains real/currently not reproduced/root cause unknown. No feature implementation/build/upload accompanies this reconciliation.

## Documentation verification / exact scope

Created this register; modified CHANGELOG.md plus CONTROL_ARCHITECTURE.md, REMOTE01_COMPLETION_ROADMAP.md, REMOTE01_RADIO_ARCHITECTURE_DECISION.md, REMOTE01_AUDIO_RADIO_AUDIT.md, REMOTE01_SD_AUDIT.md, REMOTE01_PHYSICAL_CONTROLS_PLAN.md, REMOTE01_OVERNIGHT_2_REPORT.md, REMOTE01_OVERNIGHT_EXECUTION_REPORT.md, TUNER_NATIVE_API_V1.md and STAGE_2B_LOCAL_OTA.md. Complete prior roadmap/radio/audio/architecture/API/OTA text remains byte-preserved under explicit historical/supersession overlays; overnight reports append-only; corrected SD/controls preserve exact replaced audit wording in historical quotations. CHANGELOG previous entries retained.

All38 owner items use only the six approved statuses; local Markdown-document links checked. SHA-256 scope comparison: all3982 other entry files (including source, tests, configuration, build artifacts and frozen CCM/reviews) unchanged;11 modified documents/one added/zero deleted. Documentation validation only, no compilation, tests, build or upload. Entry/final inventories retained in session TEMP; no new hardware acceptance claimed.


## Owner acceptance - 2026-10-05

**PASUL 2 - RECUPERARE + AUDIT + RECONCILIERE DECIZII: CLOSED / PASS.** Explicit owner acceptance of Today's Step2 historical recovery, audit and canonical documentation reconciliation. This closes the documentation milestone only; it does not validate or implement future product features, close historical Stage1, approve the Native API candidate or change hardware acceptance boundaries. Canonical owner decisions and existing evidence remain intact. Documentation only; no implementation/tests/configuration/artifact change, build or upload.


## New owner sleep-policy supersession - 2026-10-05

DECIDED: automatic SYSTEM_SLEEP allowed regardless of external PRESENT/ABSENT/UNKNOWN; source state is not a normal sleep eligibility condition. Previous item22 policy "Automatic system sleep remains inhibited while external-power state is not trustworthy" is SUPERSEDED. Owner reports unused overnight battery discharge apparently below approximately3.5V; this is an owner observation, not a verified cutoff/voltage/current measurement or demonstrated sole cause.

Existing motion-wake-only/first-touch-wake-only/subsequent-touch/no-PWR recovery contract retained. No automatic hard-off/SYS_EN release, new voltage threshold, charging inference or external5V-divider change authorized. Item23 planned divider remains a separate unchanged hardware direction; detecting external power is no longer a prerequisite to the new sleep policy.

AUDIT STOP BEFORE SOURCE IMPLEMENTATION: current manual light-sleep path does not stop/acknowledge NETWORK/Wi-Fi or HTTP/DNS, and2s RTC timer remains enabled each round. New policy DECIDED, implementation NOT PREPARED / lifecycle correction scope required; unchanged firmware still inhibits sleep with real UNKNOWN external state. See [exact Stage1 audit](STAGE_1_BATTERY_POWER_MANAGEMENT.md#2026-10-05---automatic-system-sleep-policy-revision-audit-stop). No build/tests/upload or hardware sleep PASS.

## Current sleep lifecycle implementation ? 2026-10-05

DECIDED: normal SYSTEM_SLEEP quiesces NETWORK/Wi-Fi before light sleep and restores NETWORK/Wi-Fi after wake. External-power telemetry remains UNKNOWN/charging UNKNOWN; sensing is useful future telemetry/policy input, no longer a prerequisite. Earlier audit STOP above is retained as prior-source history and superseded by the authorized bounded owner handshake. Normal physical-only wake; development Z2s health fallback separate. No automatic hard-off, voltage/stack/GPIO/partition/divider change. [Implementation/evidence/owner retest](SYSTEM_SLEEP_NETWORK_IMPLEMENTATION.md). SYSTEM_SLEEP + NETWORK quiesce/resume: OWNER HARDWARE VALIDATION PASS for motion wake and the2026-10-06 touch-wake/first-contact-consumption/second-contact-normal/NETWORK-diagnostics-recovery path; other unreported checks PENDING; historical Stage1 OPEN.

## Owner external circuit implementation - 2026-10-06

Item23 pin/resistor-selection planning superseded by explicit installed GPIO1/100kOhm+100kOhm owner evidence and authorized acquisition/icon implementation. Physical voltage measurements are accepted evidence, not firmware calibration/threshold/rendering PASS. Current motion/touch SYSTEM_SLEEP and NETWORK-recovery owner PASS retained; sleep/hard-shutdown policy unchanged. [First ADC/state/icon owner retest](GPIO1_EXTERNAL_POWER_SENSING.md).
