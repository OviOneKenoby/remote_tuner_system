# A-REMOTE-003 isolated D0 codec/storage qualification

2026-10-08. Coordination input531aa8cd0435ed9813ab39664888992583df0d28. Task/package authorize only standalone host/fake-backend qualification. Git-less device baseline preserved. Frozen CCM unchanged; Native unapproved/unfrozen/not implemented; O01-O17 open; D1-D5 not implemented.

13 host tests PASS,3859 counted checks,0 failures/errors;87 fault scenarios and100 fake update/recover cycles. Commands: `python -B run_qualification.py` in tools/qualification/a_remote_003. Output ../results is host-only; no live NVS/Core/ESP import/dispatch. Published evidence contains full field paths/profile, binary/JSON fixtures, SIZE_CAPACITY ledger, faults/logs/hash manifest and exact-template handoff.

Measured envelope bytes: typical pending2746/resolved3228; maximum pending35324/resolved44284. Maximum later-proof reserve8960; typical482. 3KiB candidate FAILS complete growth profile. Existing24KiB NVS cannot fit the maximum bank or update footprint. Free entries/physical fragmentation/latency/endurance/atomicity UNKNOWN, no credentials inspected.

The independent emission oracle exposes valid-old-anchor rollback hiding newer intent/barriers/non-reuse data. Missing/corrupt anchor blocks, but a valid old root is indistinguishable absent a trustworthy monotonic marker. Thus strategyA production qualification FAIL/BLOCKED. It is not a claim of an observed physical NVS defect. Rooted append-only record/monotonic-head alternative is a design proposal only; no silent alternate implementation.

No target build/soak/upload/hardware tests. No production source/config/partitions/artifacts changed; target flash/RAM/frame delta0 from unselected host files, future target codec resource cost UNKNOWN. Hardware NOT RUN / production integration NOT IMPLEMENTED. PM review and separately authorized redesign/physical qualification precede D1.
